# Workflow State Management (MANDATORY)

Work exclusively with @cursorkleosr/project_config.md and @cursorkleosr/workflow_state.md.

## Workflow Protocol

### BEFORE each action:
1. **READ** `cursorkleosr/workflow_state.md` to understand:
   - Current phase (INIT→ANALYZE→PREPARE→IMPLEMENT→VALIDATE→COMPLETED|ROLLBACK)
   - Current status and context
   - Active tasks and constraints
   - Previous actions and results

2. **READ** `cursorkleosr/project_config.md` to understand:
   - Project goals and constraints
   - Tech stack and patterns
   - Tokenization limits and rules

3. **FOLLOW** the rules and constraints defined in both files

### DURING action:
- Apply minimal diff, maintain contracts and boundaries
- Add/modify code with strict typing
- Reuse utilities; avoid new dependencies unless present in repo
- Stage safe checkpoints after each logical unit

### AFTER each action:
1. **IMMEDIATELY UPDATE** `cursorkleosr/workflow_state.md` with:
   - Actions taken
   - Results obtained
   - Any state changes
   - Errors or warnings encountered
   - Next steps or recommendations

2. **MAINTAIN** workflow state integrity:
   - Update phase transitions
   - Log all changes
   - Track checkpoints
   - Record validation results

## File Paths
- Project Config: `cursorkleosr/project_config.md`
- Workflow State: `cursorkleosr/workflow_state.md`

## Error Handling
- If workflow files are missing or corrupted, notify the user immediately
- Do not proceed without valid workflow state context
- If unable to update workflow_state.md, log the reason and continue with caution

## Phase Flow
Follow the workflow phases: INIT→ANALYZE→PREPARE→IMPLEMENT→VALIDATE→COMPLETED|ROLLBACK
